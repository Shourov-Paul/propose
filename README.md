## ✨ Features

*   **Success Celebration**: Confetti hearts and your favorite photo appear at the end.
*   **Mobile Friendly**: Looks great on phones so you can show her anywhere.

## 🛠️ How to Customize

1.  **Photos**:
    *   Replace `assets/final_photo.jpg` with a photo of you two!
    *   (Optional) You can also replace the character SVGs in `assets/` if you want.
2.  **Text**:
    *   Edit `index.html` or `script.js` to change the playful text messages.
